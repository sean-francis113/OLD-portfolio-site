                <h3 id="parttitle">III</h3>
                <br>
                <div id="parttext">
                    <p>The mass immediately separated into individuals and Lothra immediately regretted going at them alone. If she was counting right, she was about to face twelve-to-one odds. And, as she and Veilcrath openly challenged them, something akin to a duel among the dragons, they were all going to fight and kill them both.</p><br>

                    <p>She gritted her teeth. They had already made their bed. Time to lie in it.</p><br>

                    <p>After the years upon years of being together, Veilcrath and Lothra had a special connection that they did not really understand. It was as if they were directly connected to each other&#39;s mind when Lothra was mounted. So, when Veilcrath had chosen her first target, a bright red adult dragon straight ahead and a bit above them, Lothra immediately focused on it as well.</p><br>

                    <p>Her friend rushed forward, claws ready to rake, and aimed for the red dragon&#39;s belly. Either that dragon was the slowest of the bunch, or he was surprised by the attack, as he did not avoid the attack to his weakest point. Lothra felt Veilcrath&#39;s claws sink into the soft skin and tear from front to back. Blood flowed and the dragon roared in agony. Lothra watched as it spun in a spiral toward the ground and crashed hard into the city&#39;s park.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath immediately flipped herself vertical and launched up into the sky. She then curved right back around and fell like a comet onto another dragon, this one a smaller blue beast. Once on top of her opponent, she tore at the scales protecting its body.</p><br>

                    <p>While Veilcrath was fast, one of the fastest dragons in the world, she was not strong. It was easy to tell as all she really did was start bearing the dragon to the ground and pull out a relatively few scales. The dragon roared out a cry of help, and Veilcrath soon found herself being flung off of the blue beast.</p><br>

                    <p>Dragon and rider tumbled end over end while Veilcrath struggled to stabilize themselves. When she did, they were immediately faced with two dragons barreling toward them. Veilcrath leaned into a left spiraling dive and then flattened herself again. Lothra looked behind them and confirmed that the two dragons were now chasing them. They mirrored Veilcrath as they descended as well, and they were joined by three more dragons.</p><br>

                    <p>Cursing, Lothra unsheathed her two blades and started calculating numbers in her head. Veilcrath noticed her line of thought and said, &quot;Get ready.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She then ascended as sharply and swiftly as she could. Lothra kept her eyes behind her and watched as the dragons followed as best as they could. They could not match Veilcrath&#39;s maneuverability, but they made up for it with creative determination. Within seconds, they were right back on Veilcrath&#39;s tail.</p><br>

                    <p>Without needing to warn her friend, Lothra unclenched herself from the dragon&#39;s neck and let gravity decide her course. She fell down and flipped herself in the air.</p><br>

                    <p>This was going to be tough. She had to be precise. There were numerous chances to get this right, but if she missed all of them, only the ground awaited her.</p><br>

                    <p>Within seconds of her descent, she was faced with the scaly back of the dragon in front of the chase. Lothra took in a breath to calm herself, flipped one of her blades backhanded, and thrust forward.</p><br>

                    <p>Normally, the blade would have bounced right off. Dragon scales were thick as well as durable. Regular steel and iron do not have the power to cut through that material. It was why Dragonlords, a group she used to belong to, used Dragonscale to make their armor. Dragon scales were the ultimate armor making material.</p><br>

                    <p>Yet, what she held in her hands were not normal blades. They have been enhanced with a special oil and spell that only Dragonlords knew how to make. And when the blade touched the scales of the dragon in front of her, the scales parted as if she was cutting paper.</p><br>

                    <p>The dragon roared in pain.</p><br>

                    <p>Momentum caused her to slide down the dragon&#39;s back until she finally stopped herself about halfway down. She slowly worked her way back up to the dragon&#39;s neck, and while she did, the beast broke from the rest and started working to fling her off. It tried to spin her off by spiraling down to earth, it flew upside down to try and let gravity do the work, and it tried to get the other dragons to get her off. Each time a dragon tried to grab her or attack her, Lothra used her other blade to fend them off. The pain that the oil caused prevented them from getting a good grasp.</p><br>

                    <p>She finally made it to the neck, near the dragon&#39;s jaw after ten minutes of climbing and fighting for her life. Using her blades, she planted herself so she would not fall off after what she was about to do. Once she was confident that she would be relatively safe, she lifted one of her blades up, and slammed it into the jaw of the dragon. It roared and the movement of its mouth threatened to fling her off, but she was planted in tight and would not let go easily. She then concentrated on the blade and sent energy through it. When ready, she unleashed the concentrated energy into a lance of arcane power that stabbed through the dragon&#39;s mouth and into its brain.</p><br>

                    <p>The dragon&#39;s roar gradually grew quiet as its life faded and it started falling toward the ground. Lothra pulled the blade out, sheathed it, and sent out another red comet-like flare. Within seconds, Veilcrath was under the falling dragon, and Lothra pulled out her other blade. She fell, flipped in the air, and landed hard on her friend&#39;s neck.</p><br>

                    <p>She turned around and found that the chase was still on. There were two dragons less, not counting the one that she just killed, but the ones that were still alive added two more to the mix and they all kept coming.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;I can&#39;t do that again.&quot; Lothra panted, &quot;That took more work than I thought it would.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Veilcrath said, &quot;The city&#39;s guards are helping.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>As if to confirm her statement, she curved around and aimed straight for the city. She then flattened out above the city and flew by. Lothra heard the sound of ballista and magic cannons firing behind them, and turned to see that two more dragons started falling from the sky with wounds caused by the siege weapons.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath curved in a u-shape to pass over the city again. This time, though, the chasing dragons continued on their way over the city and to the other side. They then circled outside of the siege weapon&#39;s effective range and returned to fight Veilcrath.</p><br>

                    <p>As they shot right back toward her, Lothra&#39;s friend opened her jaws wide and let loose with a powerful spray of golden fire. The enhancements the Dragonlords made during her hatching intermingled with the fire in a dark blue mist. The blast engulfed the group of dragons and halted their progress. Multiple roars of anger rose up from the group. They were not damaged significantly yet this gave the guards on the walls of Valia a chance to aim their weapons to maximize their accuracy, despite their range, and open fire.</p><br>

                    <p>More than half of the arrows and arcane blasts missed their mark completely. Another quarter of the shots only grazed the massive beasts. But the few shots that did hit managed to hit hard. Two of the four dragons engaged with Veilcrath fell to the earth and a third staggered but remained in flight. Veilcrath, using Lothra&#39;s interpretation of the shot&#39;s effect, closed her jaws and lanced forward toward the injured dragon. Still recovering from the fire, the dragon had not a prayer of survival as Veilcrath spiraled under the dragon, so her claws faced the creature&#39;s belly and raked at the soft flesh. Roars of anger turned to death breaths as the dragon fell to the ground.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath immediately shot forward to avoid an attack from the fourth dragon. Lothra&#39;s leg flashed in pain as her connection with her friend sensed the claws ripping into Veilcrath&#39;s flank. This time, it was her friend that roared in agony, yet she kept flying. She curved up into the air, flipped around, and dived down upon the dragon. Lothra jerked around as her friend landed on and bit down upon the dragon&#39;s neck.</p><br>

                    <p>Their opponent flipped out of her grip and launched forward. Veilcrath struggled to right herself but could not do it before their opponent crashed into them and bore them toward the ground at a suicidal rate. The pair only had seconds to let go or else they would crash into the ground. Veilcrath spiraled around, allowing their opponent&#39;s claws to sink into scales and flesh, and practically tossed the dragon into the ground.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath struggled to right herself and barely managed to before she landed running then stumbling to her side. Lothra felt every wound and the exhaustion on Veilcrath. She jumped off of her friend when the dragon fell to her side and patted her head. Looking up, she could see that the remaining dragons, who were watching the fight the whole time, turned around and flew off.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Damnit.&quot; She muttered, &quot;I knew they had lost their way. But to attack cities? What is going on?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Horse hooves pounded. Lothra turned around and found six mounted guards riding to her. The lead rider, obviously the guard captain, dismounted, &quot;Greetings, Dragonlord.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She bowed to him, &quot;I am Dragonlord no more.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>He quirked an eyebrow at her, &quot;Really?&quot; He shrugged, &quot;No matter. We have you to thank for defending our capital.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said as she started healing Veilcrath with golden-runed hands, &quot;but I am afraid the fight is not done yet.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Dragons do not normally retreat.&quot; She said, &quot;They are aggressive beasts. When they fight, they fight to the bitter end. And they also do not strategize by focusing on the one person that has a great chance of killing them.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Why have they done so then?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She sighed in relief as she felt the injuries in Veilcrath start to fade, &quot;They are being led. By a Dragonlord.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>The guard captain froze while his men and women behind him started muttering to themselves. Lothra used the moment of non-distraction to continue her work. The golden light from her hands flowed in lines along Veilcrath&#39;s scales. They shot towards each wound on her body and the wounds started closing as if on their own.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;A Dragonlord leads them?&quot; The guard captain finally sputtered, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra shook her head, &quot;I do not know. I feared corruption among the group. That is why I left. But I did not think that it would go this far.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;What do we do about this?&quot; He asked in a stunned voice.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;For now?&quot; She said as she finished what she could, &quot;Defend the capital. We can ask questions later.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;They will be back?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;I am sure of it. No matter what their end goal is they will be back. At this point, they cannot allow failure.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;We must return to the capital then.&quot; He turned to his guards and started rambling off orders. Lothra was surprised. Despite the fact that he had just led the defense against one of the most nightmarish foes of humans, he was calm and collected. His men all saluted and rode off toward the barely open gate of Valia.</p><br>

                    <p>When they were out of earshot, the guard captain returned his gaze toward Lothra, &quot;As of right now, you have everything the capital has to help you fight off the attack. What do you need?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She blinked at him, &quot;You trust me?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You have shown that you have the interest of Valia in mind. You&#39;ve risked your life, and the life of your dragon, to defend us. I have no doubt that you are what we need to survive.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She nodded, &quot;Alright. Well, first and foremost, I need food and drink for both of us. That fight exhausted us.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>The man nodded, &quot;I&#39;ll have some brought out to you. What else?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;I do not know what defenses you have, but anything you can use to help immobilize dragons would be a great benefit. Also, be prepared for dragons to attack the city rather than us. If I am right and a Dragonlord is indeed at the head of this attack, then they may try to use the city against me or just attack to get what they want.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;We have artifice shields, but they will not hold back an attack for long. We have to use it as a last resort.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Do not be afraid to throw it up. Especially if we fall.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Alright. We will go prepare. Good luck to you.&quot;</p>
