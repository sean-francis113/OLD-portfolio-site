                <div id="parttext">
                    <p>The next hour was full of waiting for the pair. Below them, the guards were rushing back and forth preparing the siege weapons and getting ammo ready. Even from their altitude, Lothra could hear their yelling. At the ten minute mark, though, everyone fell silent. The only sounds around them at that point were just the flapping of Veilcrath&#39;s wings.</p><br>

                    <p>When the dragons arrived, instead of immediately attacking, they just floated outside of the siege weapon&#39;s range. The lead dragon, a very dark red one, inched closer to Lothra and Veilcrath. The woman recognized the man on top of the dragon, even without being able to look at him.</p><br>

                    <p>The Dragonmaster wanted to talk.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath seemed to hesitate. She was not sure if she should meet with the man. Lothra was not sure either. Yet, she directed the dragon to do so and they ended up being about thirty feet away from each other. When the man spoke, his voice was loud enough to reach Lothra.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;It&#39;s you.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Lothra said, &quot;Do you think you really killed me?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;I had hoped. But, that problem will be fixed soon enough.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You wanted to talk. So talk.&quot; Lothra growled.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Stand aside.&quot; He said, &quot;And convince the city to surrender.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra blinked at him, &quot;Why? You just threatened to kill me, yet you are giving me a chance at mercy?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;I don&#39;t do it for you.&quot; He said, &quot;I would kill you anyway. But the sooner I control the city, the sooner I can move on. And the less I kill, the more I have to use.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;What makes you think I would want to help you?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You would be saving many lives that would die otherwise.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She laughed, &quot;No. I won&#39;t help you. After what you did to me I want to see you with a blade through your gut.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>He attacked without warning. His dragon, Ralcrath, flattened out and charged forward. Veilcrath expected it, though, and directed herself at an angle so she would be right under Ralcrath. Without room to spin around she instead kept moving and clamped her jaws on the neck of another dragon. The dragon&#39;s rider yelled as they were flung off by the force and sent tumbling to the ground. Veilcrath then twisted around, pulling the dragon with her, and flung her victim at the Dragonmaster.</p><br>

                    <p>Ralcrath curved vertically upward and back around to fly toward Veilcrath. The thrown dragon missed and descended upon the city. It managed to right itself quickly, but not before ballista and cannon blasts shot toward it and crashed hard. With a cry of pain, the dragon fell to the earth.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath dived down at a steep angle both dodging Ralcrath&#39;s claws and the blasts of arcane, fire and ice from the other Dragonlords. She then flipped herself to the vertical and used her momentum to launch. Her head slammed into Ralcrath&#39;s belly with enough force to push the dragon further into the air.</p><br>

                    <p>The red dragon shot forward, curved around and let loose with a breath of fire. Lothra grunted, called forth energy, and swung her glowing hand in an arc. Translucent energy appeared in a curve that covered Veilcrath&#39;s head and neck completely. The fire collided with the curve and was deflected to the sides. Lothra knew what they were trying to do and Veilcrath responded to her thoughts. The dragon turned to face their opponent and when Ralcrath appeared behind the fire about ten feet away she was ready. She tilted her head away from Ralcrath&#39;s bite and clamped down on its neck.</p><br>

                    <p>She recoiled and roared in agony.</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra felt the pain in her own mouth and it was as if her whole mouth was melting like ice in a fire. What the hell was that? Dragons were very resilient beasts. There was not much humans can do can really harm one of them. Normal humans developed their artifices and ballista, which used pure power not seen anywhere else to pierce through dragons&#39; scales with brute force. Dragons had the power to punch through without much issue, even the weaker ones like Veilcrath. Yet, there is only one thing that could get that kind of reaction from the beasts.</p><br>

                    <p>And the Dragonmaster somehow got the stuff all over Ralcrath&#39;s scales.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath would not be able to touch the dragon without getting the same reaction every time. Which meant that it was going to be up to Lothra.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Remember what you told me not to do?&quot; She asked.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath turned around and retreated from Ralcrath, &quot;I understand.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>She charged right for one of the other dragons, flipped around and clawed at their belly. As she did, another dragon came up and virtually did the same exact thing to Veilcrath. Lothra felt pain slice across her back in multiple sets of three lines.</p><br>

                    <p>She gritted her teeth and sent a lance of fire at the Dragonlord below her. He flinched out of the way, getting a line of burns on his cheek, and returned the favor with ice. The ice crashed against Veilcrath&#39;s scales and did nothing to harm her.</p><br>

                    <p>She managed to let go of the belly of the dragon above her, fling the dragon on her off, and fly away unsteadily. Two dragons tried to descend upon her but she let loose with blasts of fire that held them away long enough for her to get away.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath then turned around and shot toward Ralcrath, who was just hovering in the air watching the fight. Three dragons intercepted her, though, and she had to fall in a spiraling descent before she ran into them. Blasts, lances and bolts of arcane, fire and ice flew across the sky toward Lothra. She flung out her hand to defend against the spells, but she was not fast enough. Fire licked against her shoulder, ice stabbed through her hand and arcane energy flowed through her body. Screams burst from her mouth and Veilcrath let out a growl of pain. Yet, the dragon flattened out parallel to the ground and then rose back up toward Ralcrath.</p><br>

                    <p>As if giving them a smirk, Ralcrath opened his jaws and sent a relative puff of fire toward them. Yet, if it hit Lothra, she would not be able to survive it. Veilcrath curved around it and was met with four more dragons who flew in her path.</p><br>

                    <p>She growled and, instead of flying away, shot forward toward the left-most dragon. Her target did not have much a chance before she opened her jaws, bit into the dragon&#39;s belly, and kept moving without losing her speed. As she did, Lothra shot out blasts of fire toward the other three Dragonlords. They all flinched away from the attacks, but the hesitation allowed Veilcrath to get away without being attacked herself.</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra&#39;s friend then circled around, grabbed a second dragon&#39;s neck, and shot toward the city. The dragon in her grip thrashed around and caused Veilcrath to stumble in the air but she managed to get close enough to throw the dragon in range of the siege weapons. As she circled back around to target Ralcrath, Lothra watched as the guards of Valia did not hesitate to fill the dragon with arrows and cannon shots.</p><br>

                    <p>The two remaining dragons that blocked the pair&#39;s path to Ralcrath shot toward Veilcrath. This time, however, the Dragonlords riding the two dragons leapt toward Veilcrath when they were close enough and used their weapons to latch onto the green dragon.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath screamed in agony as the oil touched her flesh. Lothra snarled, stood on Veilcrath&#39;s back, and rushed for the two Dragonlords. They rose to their own feet and brandished their blades. Lothra pulled out her two blades and rushed forward.</p><br>

                    <p>One blade caught the left Dragonlord&#39;s weapon on its descent and her other weapon stabbed forward. Her opponent twisted to the side and her weapon only cut off a couple of the scales on his armor. The other Dragonlord slashed her back open. She growled, spun around, and sent her longsword into the Dragonlord&#39;s torso. Then, she twisted back around and slashed at the first Dragonlord&#39;s belly.</p><br>

                    <p>He arched back so Lothra&#39;s blade, once again, only cut off a few scales. Lothra had only a second to avoid his counter attack. She ducked under his weapon and thrust forward. Again, the Dragonlord managed to twist aside and came in with a counter. The weapon cut into her own armor and left a thin line on her forearm. Growling, Lothra shoved the blade aside and slid into the Dragonlord&#39;s defenses. He tried to step away, but she grabbed onto his arm to keep him close and stabbed. Her blade sunk into the man&#39;s belly and she twisted it before pulling it back out.</p><br>

                    <p>Two roars of anger grabbed Lothra&#39;s attention and she looked to the side. The two dragons, now lord-less, angled themselves toward Veilcrath, who was holding back another dragon that apparently snuck up on her.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Veilcrath!&quot; Lothra yelled.</p><br>

                    <p>She felt the dragon key in on her thoughts. Veilcrath bashed into her opponent, stunning it for the precious second she needed to send herself up into the sky. The two dragons barreled after Veilcrath with the ferocity that only a dragon could match. She sent them through loops, sharp turns and fast descents, yet they just kept on her tail.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Veilcrath!&quot; Lothra said over the noise, &quot;They might be angry enough to chase you over the city!&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Throughout the whole fight, Valia had been defending against the dragons that decided to completely ignore Lothra and Veilcrath. Looking at it, it was burning and most of the city was destroyed. Yet, three of the four walls were still intact and they somehow managed to get the weapons on top of the buildings that still stood and used those. The three dragons that still lived and were attacking the city had to divide their attention between the walls and the inner city, who now had the same amount of firepower.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath tilted around to face the besieged city and shot as fast as she could for it. Lothra was glad to see that the dragons did follow them. The wall to their left noticed their descent onto the city and aimed their weapons. As she passed over the city, Veilcrath opened her jaws and let loose with her fire breath at every dragon she could see. One of them was right in her path, and when she stunned it with her breath, she flew under the dragon and Lothra cut open its belly with both blades.</p><br>

                    <p>Behind them, Lothra could hear the two angry dragons cry out in pain. She looked to see the dragons start nose diving toward the city in death. The dragon she just killed did the same and all three crashed into what looked like the throne room of the castle. The other two dragons tried to escape from the siege weapons&#39; range, but they were not quick enough. They fell to their deaths outside of the city.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath turned back around to face Ralcrath and the rest of the attacking force. They were not moving. The four dragons and Dragonlords that remained of the attack force hovered in the air watching the pair. Siege weapons tried to hit them, but they were just out of range.</p><br>

                    <p>With the brief respite that they were giving everyone, Lothra could feel the exhaustion and pain start creeping up on her. She was not sure, but she imagined that they had been fighting non-stop for about half an hour. Which did not seem like much, but when the scale of fighting was taken all the way up to the level of dragons, it was easy to see that everyone was starting to become ragged.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;We have to finish this.&quot; Lothra said.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Yes. But how will we attack Ralcrath?&quot; Veilcrath asked, &quot;With the dragon bane oil on him, I will not be able to attack.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;In order for the Dragonmaster to put it on Ralcrath, then it must be a slightly different mixture than normal. Which means that I should still be able to punch through it with my blades. Make passes and I will attack. You have to keep moving or else we will be pinned down by the remaining Dragonlords.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath snorted in anticipation, &quot;Alright. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>With that, she flattened herself down and flashed toward the group of attackers. She angled herself slightly below Ralcrath and Lothra prepared her blades. Ralcrath roared and shot toward Veilcrath as well. The green dragon had to adjust herself, but when they met, Lothra was able to thrust her blades up. They connected, yet Ralcrath managed to angle himself in time to only get a relative scratch instead of a lethal gash.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath curved upward, looped around and came down into a steep dive upon Ralcrath. He saw this coming, and fell at a slight angle and to the left before ascending again. When he was slightly above Veilcrath, he turned sharply and shot toward her. Veilcrath was about to fly away, but Lothra yelled, &quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Ralcrath slammed into them.</p><br>

                    <p>And his neck was right where Lothra wanted it.</p><br>

                    <p>She ignored the sudden pain that flared in her belly and stabbed both blades down. They both sank to the hilt and the dragon roared in agony. Lothra then twisted the blades and started pulling them to the side. It would have flown away from the pair, but Veilcrath held the beast in place so Lothra could finish cutting out a section of its neck.</p><br>

                    <p>It went limp.</p><br>

                    <p>But not before clawing at Veilcrath one last time.</p><br>

                    <p>Fresh pain flashed in Lothra&#39;s chest and belly. And then her stomach fluttered as both dragons fell from the sky. She could tell that Veilcrath was trying to control her fast descent but she was too weak. The beasts crashed into the ground and Lothra was flung off. She slammed into the ground and then tumbled end over end until momentum finally let her slide to a stop.</p><br>

                    <p>Blearily she looked up and saw two massive forms intertwined with each other. Lothra tried to rise, to rush to Veilcrath. She had to heal her friend before she died. Yet, something grabbed the back of her armor and tossed her away.</p><br>

                    <p>She flew through the air then crashed back into the ground. Groaning, Lothra tried to sit up but a hand grabbed her neck and lifted her up. The grip tightened more and more on her windpipe and she choked out a breath.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You.&quot; The Dragonmaster growled. He was angry. More than that, he was furious. Lothra could hear it in his voice.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You got in my way again! You have ruined my plans again!&quot; Using the grip on her neck, he slammed her back onto the ground twice. He then lifted her back up and punched her gut.</p><br>

                    <p>She was blacking out. If she did not do something, she would go unconscious. Which, in this case, is the same thing as death. So, she pulled her hand back and thrust her two fingers forward. They stabbed into the man&#39;s eyes and he immediately dropped her.</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra coughed and panted heavily as she was finally able to take in air. Looking up, she could see that the Dragonmaster was stumbling back holding hands up to his bleeding eyes. She struggled to her feet, a difficult thing to do under the circumstances, and tried to find her blades.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Bitch!&quot; He yelled, &quot;You bitch! I will kill you!&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>He drew the large great sword at his back and charged forward. Lothra ducked under his first attack, sidestepped the next and pushed herself forward. She was trying to knock him down, but he held his ground. The pommel of his greatsword crashed against her back and she fell. Without hesitation, she rolled to the side and heard the sword hit where she was only seconds before.</p><br>

                    <p>She got to her feet and took a few steps back to get away from the blade&#39;s reach. The Dragonlord&#39;s eyes were bleeding and red beyond repair, yet they still tracked her movements. He could still see her.</p><br>

                    <p>And as if to prove that point, he rushed at her again and thrust his blade toward her chest. Lothra twisted to the side and sent a punch at his face. Her fist connected and the Dragonmaster stumbled backward.</p><br>

                    <p>At this point, they were both panting heavily. She was nearing the limit of her energy, and she could tell that the Dragonmaster was as well. But he still came at her.</p><br>

                    <p>Downward slash, thrust, slash, slash, uppercut. He was relentless in his assault. Lothra had no opportunity to counter as she had to concentrate on avoidance. All she needed was just one moment of hesitation. If she could manage that, then she could work on ending this fight.</p><br>

                    <p>Thankfully, that moment came relatively quickly.</p><br>

                    <p>As the Dragonmaster thrust forward, he twisted his ankle wrong and he stumbled. Lothra dodged the thrust, kicked his blade away, and slammed her fist into his nose. She felt blood on her fist, but she did not hesitate before she grabbed the back of his head and thrust it into the ground. Her hand wrapped around the handle of the greatsword and before she could think about it, she stabbed it into the Dragonlord&#39;s heart.</p><br>

                    <p>He let out a blood filled gasp, &quot;Ha. You did it. But what about the aftermath?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>He fell limp.</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra, panting heavily, stared at what she had done for a few seconds. She killed him. Finally, she had stopped his power hungry actions. Yet, she felt nothing but exhausted.</p><br>

                    <p>She slowly rose to her feet and stumbled her way toward Veilcrath. The dragon was laying down on her side, and Lothra could see that the beast was still breathing. She tripped and managed to fall against Veilcrath.</p><br>

                    <p>And closed her eyes.</p>
