                <h3 id="parttitle">IV</h3>
                <br>
                <div id="parttext">
                    <p>Two hours later, Lothra found herself sitting down on the ground. Her back leaned against Veilcrath&#39;s neck which was wrapped around her as if protecting her. The dragon was asleep, her head near the stretcher of raw meat. Lothra had a long forgotten tray of soldier&#39;s rations next to her as well, and she sipped at the second mug of water.</p><br>

                    <p>During their meal and afterward, she had been thinking about the dragon attack. Mainly, why was it happening? When she was exiled from the Dragonlord faction, the Dragonmaster was speaking of being the ultimate power of the world. That he would prove it. In fact, that was the last line he said to her before he literally threw her off of the floating city of Drakya. She would have died if it was not for Veilcrath&#39;s quick thinking.</p><br>

                    <p>Was this a statement then? A statement saying that the Dragonlords would become the rulers of the world? It would be potent, especially since they started with the strongest nation. If they managed to take Valia, then it would only be a matter of time before the other nations either surrendered or were destroyed. Survivors would be running for the hills and most likely would be hunted down. The only hope they would have would be a resistance force within the Dragonlord faction.</p><br>

                    <p>Unfortunately, that was not likely to happen. The Dragonmaster commanded great fear among the faction he ruled. Lothra was the only one that dared to speak out against the Dragonmaster and he showed what would happen to others like her very clearly. Either the Dragonmaster was killed here or war will begin all across the face of Ives. Nations against Dragonlord. Dragonlord against Dragonlord. And if Valia survived the battle not only would they be the main leader in the war but Lothra would be pulled in as well. Maybe even become the commander of the whole fighting force.</p><br>

                    <p>She was not sure how to think about that. Of course, she did not want war to clash and she certainly did not want to be at the forefront of it. Yet, the idea of finally being able to fight against the Dragonmaster after years of trying to bring him down was pleasure on a different level. Which really scared her. She wanted to bring the man down. Not become him along the way. The emotions would not be ignored though.</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra sighed. This must have been the temptation she was warned about when she was initiated into the Dragonlords. They said that the connection between her and her dragon would change her personality. She would become more like the dragons and her partner would in turn become more human. That would bring in more of the aggressive bloodlust and primal nature of the dragons into her.</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath seemed to sense Lothra&#39;s confusion and unease. She pulled her head closer to the woman and looked at her with a green eye.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You are troubled.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra smirked, &quot;No kidding.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;The upcoming fight frightens you.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra gave the dragon&#39;s eye a narrowed eye glance, &quot;Yes. Obviously.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath chuckled quietly. Which meant that the ground around them only vibrated instead of becoming an earthquake.</p><br>

                    <p>The narrow eyed glance narrowed even further, &quot;You&#39;re laughing at me.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Humans have always been amusing. You especially.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>The woman&#39;s expression went confused and she tilted her head, &quot;What?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;You worry about the future, yet you will just keep moving on anyway. So why worry?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Because I want to make sure I understand what may happen.&quot; Lothra said, &quot;And I want to make sure I don&#39;t ruin myself while I face it.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath chuckled again, &quot;Exactly. You think you can change the inevitable. Why worry about something that cannot be changed?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra shrugged, &quot;Because worrying about it is inevitable?&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath hesitated, then laughed, &quot;Sure.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra smiled as she returned her glance to the setting sky. On the horizon she could see dozens upon dozens of shapes. At that distance, they would be on the city in another hour.</p><br>

                    <p>She rose to her feet, stretched with her arms straight above her, and patted the dragon&#39;s neck. The beast stood up and stretched her neck. She then lowered said neck to allow Lothra to mount. The woman did, and they slowly ascended.</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;They are not going to come from just one direction.&quot; Lothra said, &quot;Be prepared for flankers.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Veilcrath snorted, &quot;You just make sure not to try and ride the others.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Lothra said with a grin, &quot;you let me do that!&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>&quot;Don&#39;t make me fling you off.&quot;</p><br>

                    <p>Lothra laughed, &quot;Well. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
